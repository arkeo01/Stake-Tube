## Problems that we aim to solve
1. Control of a central authority or an organization over the content created by the creators
2. The content creator does not get the true value for the content that they deserve.

## Solution Proposed
We have created a video platform which would help the content creators to get the right or appropriate cost of their content (specifically videos for this version) and also serves as an Investment and Incentivization platform for all the content consuming users.

Let us understand the platform in some simple steps:

1. The user using its Metamasak wallet automatically gets authenticated to access the dashboard.
2. Currently, there are two major actions that the user can perform
 (i) He can upload his content. 
 (ii) He can watch the contents uploaded by others and invest in them.
3. The content would be accessed through IPFS(InterPlanetary File System), a peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system.
4. The content creator gets half of every investment made by a user, while the other half is distributed among the investors before that user, such that the early viewers have a more significant stake than the later investors.

## Challenges that were faced
1. Proper incentivization algorithm was challenging to figure out at first.
2. Being new to dapp development, various bugs emerged while integrating the platform with MetaMask.
3. Had to learn Vue.js framework from grounds up because of few functionality constraints on the previous model.
4. The ideation component was so vast, that we were only able to present a broad Proof Of Concept.

## Tech Stack Used 
1. Solidity 
2. Javascript 
3. Vue.js
4. Matic Network
5. Remix-IDE
